== Release Instructions

Just tag the repository. There is no need to change master during release. Please keep tags to form `vX` where `v` is always a `v` and `X` is the release number.

IMPORTANT: *Boosters that point to master MUST  be removed.*

```
git checkout -B release
# Remove all YAML files that point to master
find . -name "*.yaml" -type f -exec grep -q 'ref: master' {} \; -exec rm {} \;
git commit -m "Updating to v1"
git tag v1
git push --tags
git checkout master 
git branch -D release
```

== How to make the release effective in production?

File an issue in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/dtsd/housekeeping/issues to have the Service Delivery team perform the necessary changes in the production env (example in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/dtsd/housekeeping/issues/643).
